Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2011–2022), this study evaluates Maryland’s All-Payer Model (MDAPM, 2014–2018) and Total Cost of Care Model (MDTCOC, 2019–2022) through a difference-in-differences approach comparing Maryland with other states. Preliminary results show that MDAPM was associated with modest improvements in health behaviors, including a 1.62 percentage-point increase in physical activity. Under MDTCOC, stronger effects emerged: smoking decreased by 9.29 percentage points, drinking by 2.59 percentage points, and cardiovascular disease prevalence by 6.67 percentage points, alongside gains in vaccination rates and exercise participation. However, chronic conditions such as obesity and asthma showed little change, underscoring the limitations of budget caps in addressing complex health challenges. Overall, the findings suggest that while budget cap models are not comprehensive solutions, they can promote healthier behaviors and preventive care. Integrating payment reforms with broader public health strategies is essential for achieving sustained and equitable health improvements.
