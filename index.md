I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the City University of New York – The Graduate Center.

My research focuses on evaluating large-scale healthcare reforms and their impact on population health and health behaviors. My dissertation examines Maryland’s All-Payer and Total Cost of Care models, using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to uncover how innovative payment structures shape care delivery and outcomes.

Beyond academia, I’m deeply motivated by the real-world application of evidence. I’ve collaborated with VNS Health, analyzing post-discharge care protocols for sepsis patients to identify cost-effective pathways that improve recovery and reduce hospital readmissions. These experiences have strengthened my commitment to using data to inform policy decisions that make healthcare more equitable and efficient.

Looking ahead, I’m interested in leveraging machine learning and neural network methods to uncover meaningful patterns in real-world data and improve decision-making in healthcare.
